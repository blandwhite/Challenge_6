### Background
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## What's Being Created

For this Challenge assignment, we will create and submit the following:

    A Jupyter notebook that contains an analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Python libraries used:
- Pathlib: [https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html)  
  *Pathlib is a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
 - Pandas: [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)  
    *Pandas is is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.*

 - hvPlot: [https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html)  
     *hvPlot is a high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.*



### Installation Guide

prior to running these libraries, install them from the command line:  
  - pandas: `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`  
  - pathlib: `pip install pathlib`
  - hvPlot: `conda install -c pyviz hvplot` or `pip install hvplot`

## Usage

We will use the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to complete the following tasks:

 - Calculate and plot the housing units per year.

 - Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.

 - Compare the average prices by neighborhood.

 - Build an interactive neighborhood map.

 - Compose our data story.
